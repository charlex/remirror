## Tags interface

A useful feature of the builder is being able to declaratively mark positions in content using the angled braces e.g. `<cursor>`<!-- -->.

These positions are called tags, and are tracked on every node in the tree that has a tag on any of its descendants.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface Tags 
```
