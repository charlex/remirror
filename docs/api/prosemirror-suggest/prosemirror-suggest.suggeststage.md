## SuggestStage type

A suggestion can have two stages. When it is `new` and when it has already been created and is now being `edit`<!-- -->ed.

Separating the stages allows for greater control in how mentions are updated.

The edit state is only applicable for editable suggestions. Most nodes and text insertions can't be edited once created.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type SuggestStage = 'new' | 'edit';
```
