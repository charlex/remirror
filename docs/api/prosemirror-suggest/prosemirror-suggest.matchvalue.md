## MatchValue interface

The match value with the full and partial text.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface MatchValue 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [full](./prosemirror-suggest.matchvalue.full.md) | <code>string</code> | The complete match independent of the cursor position. |
|  [partial](./prosemirror-suggest.matchvalue.partial.md) | <code>string</code> | This value is a partial match which ends at the position of the cursor within the matching text. |

## Remarks

For a suggester with a char `@` then the following text `@ab|c` where `|` is the current cursor position will create a queryText with the following signature.

```json
{ "full": "abc", "partial": "ab" }

```
