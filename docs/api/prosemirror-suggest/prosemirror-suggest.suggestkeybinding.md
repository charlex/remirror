## SuggestKeyBinding type

A method for performing actions when a certain key / pattern is pressed.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type SuggestKeyBinding<GCommand extends AnyFunction<void> = AnyFunction<void>> = (params: SuggestKeyBindingParams<GCommand>) => boolean | void;
```

## Remarks

Return true to prevent any further bubbling of the key event and to stop other handlers from also processing the event.
