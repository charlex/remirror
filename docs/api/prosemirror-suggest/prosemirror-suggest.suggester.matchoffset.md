## Suggester.matchOffset property

Sets the characters that need to be present after the initial character match before a match is triggered.

For example with `char` = `@` the following is true.

- `matchOffset: 0` matches `'@'` immediately - `matchOffset: 1` matches `'@a'` but not `'@'` - `matchOffset: 2` matches `'@ab'` but not `'@a'` or `'@'` - `matchOffset: 3` matches `'@abc'` but not `'@ab'` or `'@a'` or `'@'` - And so on...

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
matchOffset?: number;
```
