## prosemirror-suggest package

Primitives for building your prosemirror suggestion functionality.

\#\# The problem

You want to create a suggestion plugin for your prosemirror editor but are unsure how to get started. The suggestions could be for mentions, emojis, responding to a keypress with a dropdown of potential actions or anything that needs to extract a query from the current editor when a matching character is entered.

\#\# This solution

`prosemirror-suggest` provides the suggestion primitives you will need for within your editor. It doesn't try to be magical and even with this library setting up suggestions can be difficult. However, with this toolkit, you will be able to build pretty much any suggestion plugin you can think of.

\#\# Installation

```bash
yarn add prosemirror-suggest prosemirror-view

```
\#\# Getting Started

The configuration of prosemirror suggests is based around an object which defines the suggestion behaviour. This configuration is passed the `suggestion` method which adds all the suggestion plugins to the editor.

In the following example we're creating an emoji suggestion plugin that responds to the colon character with a query and presents a list of matching emojis based on the query typed so far.

```ts
import { Suggester, suggest } from 'prosemirror-suggest';

const maxResults = 10;
let selectedIndex = 0;
let emojiList: string[] = [];
let showSuggestions = false;

const suggestEmojis: Suggester = {
  // By default decorations are used to highlight the currently matched
  // suggestion in the dom.
  // In this example we don't need decorations (in fact they cause problems when the
  // emoji string replaces the query text in the dom).
  ignoreDecorations: true,
  char: ':', // The character to match against
  name: 'emoji-suggestion', // a unique name
  appendText: '', // Text to append to the created match

  // Keybindings are similar to prosemirror keymaps with a few extra niceties.
  // The key identifier can also include modifiers (e.g.) `Cmd-Space: () => false`
  // Return true to prevent any further keyboard handlers from running.
  keyBindings: {
    ArrowUp: () => {
      selectedIndex = rotateSelectionBackwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);
    },
    ArrowDown: () => {
      selectedIndex = rotateSelectionForwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);
    },
    Enter: ({ command }) => {
      if (showSuggestions) {
        command(emojiList[selectedIndex]);
      }
    },
    Esc: () => {
      showSuggestions = false;
    },
  },

  onChange: params => {
    const query = params.query.full;
    emojiList = sortEmojiMatches({ query, maxResults });
    selectedIndex = 0;
    showSuggestions = true;
  },

  onExit: () => {
    showSuggestions = false;
    emojiList = [];
    selectedIndex = 0;
  },

  // Create a  function that is passed into the change, exit and keybinding handlers.
  // This is useful when these handlers are called in a different part of the app.
  createCommand: ({ match, view }) => {
    return (emoji,skinVariation) => {
      if (!emoji) {
        throw new Error('An emoji is required when calling the emoji suggestions command');
      }

      const tr = view.state.tr; const { from, end: to } = match.range;
      tr.insertText(emoji, from, to); view.dispatch(tr);
    };
  },
};

 // Create the plugin with the above configuration. It also supports multiple plugins being added.
const suggestionPlugin = suggest(suggestEmojis);

 // Include the plugin in the created editor state.
const state = EditorState.create({schema,
  plugins: [suggestionPlugin],
});

```
