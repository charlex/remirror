## SuggestIgnoreParams.addIgnored() method

Add a match target to the ignored matches.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
addIgnored(params: AddIgnoredParams): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  params | <code>AddIgnoredParams</code> |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

`void`

## Remarks

Until the activation character is deleted no more `onChange` or `onExit` handlers will be triggered for the matched character. It will be like the match doesn't exist.

By ignoring the activation character the plugin ensures that any further matches from the activation character will be ignored.

There are a number of use cases for this. You may chose to ignore a match when:

- The user presses the `escape` key to exit your suggestion dropdown. - The user continues typing without selecting any of the options for the selection drop down. - The user clicks outside of the suggestions dropdown.

```ts
const suggester = {
  onExit: ({ addIgnored, range: { from }, suggester: { char, name } }: SuggestExitHandlerParams) => {
    addIgnored({ from, char, name }); // Ignore this suggestion
  },
}

```
