## deepMerge variable

A deep merge which only merges plain objects and Arrays. It clones the object before the merge so will not mutate any of the passed in values.

To completely remove a key you can use the `Merge` helper class which replaces it's key with a completely new object

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
deepMerge: <GType = any>(...objects: (unknown[] | PlainObject)[]) => GType
```
