## Remarks

There are subtle things that prosemirror does when it loads the document that can cause things to jump around.

The aim of this extension is to provide a series of helper transformations which deal with the typical problems that prosemirror presents when rendering on the server.

The transformations can also serve as a guideline when creating your own SSRTransforms. However in most cases the defaults should be sufficient.
