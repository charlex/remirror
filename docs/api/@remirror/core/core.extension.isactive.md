## Extension.isActive() method

Determines whether this extension is currently active (only applies to Node Extensions and Mark Extensions).

If a command name is provided (to the return function) then this method should return true if that command is currently active. Conceptually this doesn't always make sense and in those cases it should be save to just return false.
