## Extension.tags property

Tags help to categorize the behavior of an extension. This behavior is later grouped in the extension manager and passed as `tag` to each extension method. It can be used by commands that need to remove all formatting and use the tag to identify which registered extensions are formatters.

There are internally defined tags but it's also possible to define any custom string as a tag. See 

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly tags: Array<Tags | string>;
```
