## Extension.requiredExtensions property

An extension can declare the extensions it requires with options needed for instantiating them.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly requiredExtensions?: string[];
```

## Remarks

When creating the extension manager the extension will be checked for required extension as well as a quick check to see if the required extension is already included.
