## Extension interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface Extension<GOptions extends BaseExtensionOptions = BaseExtensionOptions, GType = never> 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [requiredExtensions](./core.extension.requiredextensions.md) | <code>string[]</code> | An extension can declare the extensions it requires with options needed for instantiating them. |

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [commands(params)](./core.extension.commands.md) | Register commands for the extension.<!-- -->These are typically used to create menu's actions and as a direct response to user actions. |
|  [extensionData(params)](./core.extension.extensiondata.md) | Each extension can make extension data available which is updated on each render. Think of it like the prosemirror plugins state.<!-- -->Within React this data is passed back into Remirror render prop and also the Remirror context and can be retrieved with a <code>hook</code> or <code>HOC</code> |
|  [helpers(params)](./core.extension.helpers.md) | A helper method is a function that takes in arguments and returns a value depicting the state of the editor specific to this extension. |
|  [inputRules(params)](./core.extension.inputrules.md) | Register input rules which are activated if the regex matches as a user is typing. |
|  [isActive(params)](./core.extension.isactive.md) | Determines whether this extension is currently active (only applies to Node Extensions and Mark Extensions).<!-- -->If a command name is provided (to the return function) then this method should return true if that command is currently active. Conceptually this doesn't always make sense and in those cases it should be save to just return false. |
|  [isEnabled(params)](./core.extension.isenabled.md) | Determines whether this extension is enabled. If a command name is provided then it should return a value determining whether that command is able to be run. |
|  [keys(params)](./core.extension.keys.md) | Add key bindings for this extension. |
|  [onTransaction(params)](./core.extension.ontransaction.md) | Called whenever a transaction successfully updates the editor state.<!-- -->Changes to the transaction at this point have no impact at all. It is purely for observational reasons |
|  [pasteRules(params)](./core.extension.pasterules.md) | Register paste rules for this extension.<!-- -->Paste rules are activated when text is pasted into the editor. |
|  [plugin(params)](./core.extension.plugin.md) | Register a plugin for the extension. |
|  [ssrTransformer(element, params)](./core.extension.ssrtransformer.md) | A method for transforming the SSR JSX received by the extension. Some extensions add decorations to the ProsemirrorView based on their state. These decorations can touch any node or mark and it would be very difficult to model this without being able to take the completed JSX render and transforming it some way.<!-- -->An example use case is for placeholders which need to render a <code>data-placeholder</code> and <code>class</code> attribute so that the placeholder is shown by the styles. This method can be called to check if there is only one child of the parent |
|  [styles(params)](./core.extension.styles.md) | Allows extensions to register styles on the editor instance using emotion for dynamic styling. |
|  [suggestions(params)](./core.extension.suggestions.md) | Create suggestions which respond to character key combinations within the editor instance. |
