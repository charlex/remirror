## Remarks

A mark extension is based on the `Mark` concept from from within prosemirror [https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/\#schema.marks](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#schema.marks)

Marks are used to add extra styling or other information to inline content. Mark types are objects much like node types, used to tag mark objects and provide additional information about them.
