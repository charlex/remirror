## NodeExtension.schema property

The prosemirror specification which sets up the node in the schema.

The main difference between this and Prosemirror `NodeSpec` is that that the `toDOM` method doesn't allow dom manipulation. You can only return an array or string.

For more advanced configurations, where dom manipulation is required, it is advisable to set up a nodeView.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
abstract readonly schema: NodeExtensionSpec;
```
