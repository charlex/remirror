## PrioritizedExtension interface

Provides a priority value to the extension which determines the priority.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PrioritizedExtension<GExtension extends AnyExtension = any> 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [extension](./core.prioritizedextension.extension.md) | <code>GExtension</code> | The instantiated extension |
|  [priority](./core.prioritizedextension.priority.md) | <code>number</code> | A priority given to the extension. |

## Remarks

A lower value for priority means a higher priority. Think of it as an index and position in array except that it can also support negative values.
