## Extension.ssrTransformer() method

A method for transforming the SSR JSX received by the extension. Some extensions add decorations to the ProsemirrorView based on their state. These decorations can touch any node or mark and it would be very difficult to model this without being able to take the completed JSX render and transforming it some way.

An example use case is for placeholders which need to render a `data-placeholder` and `class` attribute so that the placeholder is shown by the styles. This method can be called to check if there is only one child of the parent
