## MarkExtension.schema property

The prosemirror specification which sets up the mark in the schema.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
abstract readonly schema: MarkExtensionSpec;
```

## Remarks

The main difference between this and Prosemirror `MarkSpec` is that that the `toDOM` method doesn't allow dom manipulation. You can only return an array or string.

For more advanced requirements, it may be possible to create a nodeView to manage the dom interactions.
