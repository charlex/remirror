## getSelectedWord variable

Retrieves the nearest space separated word from the current selection.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getSelectedWord: (state: Readonly<PMEditorState<any>>) => false | FromToParams
```

## Remarks

This always expands outward so that given: `The tw<start>o words<end>` The selection would become `The <start>two words<end>`

In other words it expands until it meets an invalid character.
