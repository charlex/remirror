## bubblePositioner variable

Render a centered bubble menu which becomes active whenever a selection is made.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
bubblePositioner: Positioner
```

## Remarks

The menu will horizontally center itself `from` / `to` bounds of the current selection.

- `right` should be used to absolutely position away from the right hand edge of the screen - `left` should be used to determine absolute horizontal positioning. - `bottom` absolutely positions the element above the text selection. - `top` absolutely positions the element below the text selection
