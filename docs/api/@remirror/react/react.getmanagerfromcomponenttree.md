## getManagerFromComponentTree variable

Retrieve the extension manager from your remirror component tree.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getManagerFromComponentTree: ({ Component, prop, extraProps, }: GetManagerFromComponentTreeParams) => Promise<ExtensionManager<any>>
```

## Remarks

When building your multi-platform editor you will want to use \*\*one\*\* schema across all your environments. Since Prosemirror renders in the DOM it makes sense to set up the schema in your DOM based react code.

But how to then use that same schema across your platforms?

This function provides a way of doing just that. It requires that you set up your editor with with a wrapper component that uses the `RemirrorManager` and then provide an \_insertion point\_ prop (`children` by default) to place a component within the `RemirrorManager`<!-- -->.

This function uses the `prop` you provide to insert a component whose sole purpose is to pull the extension manager from the React context and pass it back to the consumer of this function.

```ts
// client.ts
export const MyEditorWrapper = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <RemirrorManager>
      {children}
      <RemirrorExtension Constructor={NewExtension} />
      <RemirrorExtension Constructor={PlaceholderExtension} emptyNodeClass='empty' />
    </RemirrorManager>
  );
};

// server.ts
import { MyEditorWrapper } from './client';

const manager = await getManagerFromComponentTree({
  Component: <MyEditorWrapper />,
  prop: 'children',
});

// For example now you have access to the schema
const { schema } =  manager;

```
This is useful in DOM-less (e.g. server-side) environments.
