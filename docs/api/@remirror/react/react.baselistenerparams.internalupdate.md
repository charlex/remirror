## BaseListenerParams.internalUpdate property

A shorthand way of checking whether the update was triggered by editor usage (internal) or overwriting the state.

- `true` The update was triggered by a change in the prosemirror doc or an update to the selection. In these cases `tr` will have a value. - `false` The update was caused by a call to `setContent` or `resetContent`

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
internalUpdate: boolean;
```
