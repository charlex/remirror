## extension-mention package

\#\# The problem

You'd love a simpler way to create \*\*editable\*\* `@` and `#` mentions with suggestions built into your `remirror` editor. Or perhaps you'd prefer non-editable mentions that create an inline prosemirror node. Or maybe you're keeping it simple and decide that you want mentions to output plain text into your markdown editor.

\#\# The solution

`@remirror/extension-mention` exports three `remirror` extensions for managing \*\*editable\*\* `Mark` mentions, non-editable `Node` mentions and plain text mentions. Underneath the work is being done by `prosemirror-suggest` to reduce the boilerplate needed to setup.

\#\# Installation

After completing the installation of the the `remirror` environment as shown in the \[docs\](https://docs.remirror.org/install) run the following command.

```bash
yarn add @remirror/extension-mention`

```
