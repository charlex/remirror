## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  End | <code>&quot;exit-end&quot;</code> | The user has pasted some text with multiple characters or run a command that adds multiple character.<code>onExit</code> should be called but the previous match should be retested as it's possible that it's been extended. |
|  InvalidSplit | <code>&quot;invalid-exit-split&quot;</code> | The user has pasted some text with multiple characters or run a command that adds multiple characters right after the initial multi-character. e.g. <code>@abc</code> -<!-- -->&gt; <code>@ this is newabc</code>In this case it is best to remove the mention completely. |
|  JumpBackward | <code>&quot;jump-backward-exit&quot;</code> | The user has jumped to another suggestion which occurs before the previous suggestion in the editor. This can happen via a click, a keyboard jump (END) or a custom command. In this case since there is still an active suggestion it will trigger both an <code>onExit</code> and <code>onChange</code> call. |
|  JumpForward | <code>&quot;jump-forward-exit&quot;</code> | The user has jumped to another suggestion which occurs afterwards in the editor. This can be via a click, a keyboard jump or custom commands. In this case since there is still an active suggestion it will trigger both an <code>onExit</code> and <code>onChange</code> call. |
|  MoveEnd | <code>&quot;move-end&quot;</code> | User has moved out of the suggestion at the end. This will typically be using arrow keys, but can also be via a mouse click or custom command. All that has changed is the cursor position. |
|  MoveStart | <code>&quot;move-start&quot;</code> | User has moved out of the suggestion but from the beginning. This can be via the arrow keys but can also be via a mouse click or custom command. All that changed is the cursor position. |
|  Removed | <code>&quot;delete&quot;</code> | The suggestion has been removed. |
|  SelectionOutside | <code>&quot;selection-outside&quot;</code> | The user has selected some text outside the current selection, this can trigger an exit. This can be from a triple click to select the line or Ctrl-A to select all. |
|  Split | <code>&quot;exit-split&quot;</code> | The user has pasted some text with multiple characters or run a command that adds multiple characters somewhere within the active suggestion. e.g. <code>@abc</code> -<!-- -->&gt; <code>@ab123 asdf aiti c</code><code>onExit</code> should be called but the previous match should be retested as it's possible that it's been extended. |
