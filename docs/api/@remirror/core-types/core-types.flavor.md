## Flavor type

Create a "flavored" version of a type. TypeScript will disallow mixing flavors, but will allow unflavored values of that type to be passed in where a flavored version is expected. This is a less restrictive form of branding.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Flavor<GType, GFlavor> = GType & Flavoring<GFlavor>;
```
