## DOMOutputSpec type

Defines the return type of the toDom methods for both Nodes and marks

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type DOMOutputSpec = string | [string, 0?] | [string, {
    [attr: string]: string;
}, 0?] | [string, DOMOutputSpecPos1?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?, DOMOutputSpecPosX?];
```

## Remarks

This differs from the default Prosemirror type definition which seemed didn't work at the time of writing.

Additionally we don't want to support domNodes in the toDOM spec since this will create problems once SSR is fully supported
