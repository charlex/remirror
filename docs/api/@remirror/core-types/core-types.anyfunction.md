## AnyFunction type

Concisely and cleanly define an arbitrary function.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type AnyFunction<GType = any> = (...args: any[]) => GType;
```

## Remarks

Taken from `simplytyped` Useful when designing many api's that don't care what function they take in, they just need to know what it returns.
