## LEAF\_NODE\_REPLACING\_CHARACTER variable

Explanation from `@atlaskit` ProseMirror uses the Unicode Character 'OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' (U+FFFC) as text representation for leaf nodes, i.e. nodes that don't have any content or text property (e.g. hardBreak, emoji, mention, rule) It was introduced because of https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror/issues/262 This can be used in an input rule regex to be able to include or exclude such nodes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
LEAF_NODE_REPLACING_CHARACTER = "\uFFFC"
```
