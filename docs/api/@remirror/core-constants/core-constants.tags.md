## Tags enum

These are the default supported tag strings which help categorize different behaviors that extensions can exhibit.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum Tags 
```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  FormattingMark | <code>&quot;formattingMark&quot;</code> | A mark that is used to change the formatting of the node it wraps. |
|  FormattingNode | <code>&quot;formattingNode&quot;</code> | A node that is deemed to format in a non standard way. |
|  LastNodeCompatible | <code>&quot;lastNodeCompatible&quot;</code> | Describes a node that can be used as the last node of a document and by extension doesn't need to render a node after itself. |
|  NodeCursor | <code>&quot;nodeCursor&quot;</code> | Identifies a node which has problems with cursor navigation. |

## Remarks

Any extension can register itself with multiple such behaviors and these categorizations can be used by other extensions when running commands and updating the document.
