## MarkGroup enum

Marks are categorized into different groups. One motivation for this was to allow the `code` mark to exclude other marks, without needing to explicitly name them. Explicit naming requires the named mark to exist in the schema. This is undesirable because we want to construct different schemas that have different sets of nodes/marks.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum MarkGroup 
```
