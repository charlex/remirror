## ReactNodeView.init() method

This method exists to move initialization logic out of the constructor, so the object can be initialized properly before calling render first time.

Example: Instance properties get added to an object only after super call in constructor, which leads to some methods being undefined during the first render.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
init(): this;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`this`
