## propIsFunction variable

Will throw an error if the child provided is not a function.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
propIsFunction: (prop: unknown) => prop is AnyFunction<any>
```

## Remarks

This is currently used in the remirror component to throw an error when the element children are not a render prop. It should be called outside of render for class Components.
