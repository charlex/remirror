## HSL.triadic() method

A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.

Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.

To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
triadic(): [HSL, HSL, HSL];
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`[HSL, HSL, HSL]`
