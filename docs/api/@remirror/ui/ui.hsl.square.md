## HSL.square() method

The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle.

The square color scheme works best if you let one color be dominant.

You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
square(): [HSL, HSL, HSL, HSL];
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`[HSL, HSL, HSL, HSL]`
