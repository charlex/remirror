## RemirrorThemeProviderProps.disableMerge property

By default the theme provided by this component will be merged with a parent RemirrorTheme or, in the case of the root theme, with the `baseTheme` and outer emotion theme.

Set this to true to disable merging and hence to cause the theme provided to be the only theme used for all nested components.

Set this to an array of values to disable against

- parent - disable merging with the ancestors - base - disable root providers merging with the base theme - emotion - disable merging with any outer emotion themes

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
disableMerge?: DisableMerge[];
```
