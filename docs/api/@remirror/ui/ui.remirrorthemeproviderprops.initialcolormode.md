## RemirrorThemeProviderProps.initialColorMode property

The initial color mode that will be used when the app is first loaded.

It is up to you to decide how this can be persisted between sessions. For example if a user switches to dark mode then reloads the page their settings would be lost.

To prevent this you could: - store the mode in local storage and set the color mode to reflect this - With SSR this will always lead to a flash of unstyled content since the color mode can only be retrieved once the DOM loads - store the mode in a cookie session and render the app with this color mode set from the server session.

```typescript
initialColorMode?: string;
```
