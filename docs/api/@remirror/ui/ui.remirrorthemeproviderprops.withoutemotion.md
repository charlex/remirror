## RemirrorThemeProviderProps.withoutEmotion property

Removes the emotion injected styles from the component.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
withoutEmotion?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

This is accomplished by making the `css` function a noop. It is useful for those who would prefer not to use a CSS-in-JS solution. Emotion classes are very hard to override once in place. By setting this to true, it should be much easier to configure your own styles without the burden of overriding existing styles.
