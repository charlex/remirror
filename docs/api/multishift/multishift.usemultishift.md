## useMultishift variable

\#\#\# `useMultishift`

Multishift is a hook that provides all the necessary tools for building accessible dropdown components.

It supports `select` and `autocomplete` drop down experiences with built in support for multi-selection.

The library borrows (and steals) heavily from `downshift` but also adds some features which are really important for the `remirror` project.

- Focus on typescript support - No React Native support - Multi selection support

Eventually some of the code will be contributed back to the downshift library.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
useMultishift: <GItem = any>(props: MultishiftProps<GItem>) => MultishiftReturn<GItem>
```
