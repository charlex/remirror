## ActionCreator type

An \*action creator\* is, quite simply, a function that creates an action. Do not confuse the two termsâ€”again, an action is a payload of information, and an action creator is a factory that creates an action.

Calling an action creator only produces an action, but does not dispatch it. You need to call the store's `dispatch` function to actually cause the mutation. Sometimes we say \*bound action creators\* to mean functions that call an action creator and immediately dispatch its result to a specific store instance.

If an action creator needs to read the current state, perform an API call, or cause a side effect, like a routing transition, it should return an async action instead of an action.

 A Returned action type.
