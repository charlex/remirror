## [Unreleased]

### Added

- üöÄ `@remirror/extension-collaboration`: Collaboration library added based on the brilliant example available in [tiptap](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap).
- üöÄ `@remirror/extension-mention`: Mentions can now be picked up from pasting data.
- üöÄ `@remirror/extension-code-block`: Add commands `toggleCodeBlock`, `createCodeBlock`, `updateCodeBlock` and `formatCodeBlock` also add keymap support for formatting and other features.
- `@remirror/core`: Add `CommandNodeTypeParams`, `CommandMarkTypeParams`, `CommandTypeParams` which is now passed to the `commands` method for extensions.
- `@remirror/react-utils`, `@remirror/react`: Add `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to `Remirror` component. Set to true to ignore the hydration warning for a mismatch between the server and client content.
- `@remirror/core`: Add new `extensionData` method to the `ExtensionManager` which allows extension to provide data on every transaction which will be available for consumption in the renderProp, React Context hooks and HOC's.
- `@remirror/core`: Add `getActions` to the params of all extension manager methods. This will throw an error if called before initialization.
- `jest-prosemirror`: Enable editorViewOptions for the `createEditor` method. For example, now it is possible to intercept transactions with the `dispatchTransaction` hook.
- `@remirror/renderer-react`: Pass extension options through to SSR components as a prop.

- Add internal modifier key functions for puppeteer testing.
- Add integration editor tests for the `wysiwyg` editor.

### Changes

- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Change the way commands are configured. The command function on extensions now only accepts an object with the command names being globally unique. For example the heading extension use to just return a function now it returns an object with the following signature.

```ts
{
  toggleHeading(attrs?: Attrs): CommandFunction;
}
```

This is a large breaking change and will cause a lot of existing code to stop working üò¢. However, it paves the way for a better development experience, a simpler to manage library and some exciting features using type inference. Please do bear with me as I make these changes. I truly believe they'll be worthwhile.

- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Rename `getEditorState` to `getState`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Change method `getPortalContainer` to property `portalContainer` on the extension manager.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/extension-mention`:** Complete rewrite of internals and public API with better tests and more robust editing.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/extension-mention`:** Change `MentionExtension` from `NodeType` to `MarkType`. Text is now editable after a mention is created.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** Rename `setChildAsRoot` to `childAsRoot` on `RemirrorContextProviderProps` and all it consumers. This affects the `RemirrorContextProvider`, `RemirrorProvider` and `ManagedRemirrorProvider` exports. The prop now can take a boolean or the object with props to inject into the root.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** All RemirrorProviders now require a `children` prop. This prevents a bug when rendering in non-dom environments.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** `dispatchTransaction` has been renamed to `onDispatchTransaction`. It now must return a `transaction` and can be used to edit the transaction that will be used to create a new state.

- üêõ `@remirror/core`: Fix bug with extension manager failing to provide attributes from the extensions.
- üêõ `@remirror/core`: Fix TypeScript type of SSRComponent. Change from `Component` to `ComponentType`.
- üêõ `@remirror/editor-twitter`: Fix bug where text area didn't expand to full height of editor container.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-07-06

### Added

- `@remirror/react`: Add `withoutEmotion` which, when set to `true`, removes emotion (css-in-js) from the `Remirror` component. This is for those who don't like css-in-js and would like to work directly with the raw editor without random styles injected. Consuming the `@remirror/react-components` or any of the `@remirror/editor-*` packages will require the use of emotion.
- `@remirror/react-utils`: Add `oneChildOnly` export which throws readable errors for invalid children props.

### Changed

- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react-utils`:** Rename `childIsFunction` to `propIsFunction` and make it a _pseudo_ predicate function (returns true when it doesn't throw an error).
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** Rename `setChildAsRoot` to `childAsRoot` on `RemirrorContextProviderProps` and all it consumers. This affects the `RemirrorContextProvider`, `RemirrorProvider` and `ManagedRemirrorProvider` exports. The prop now can take a boolean or the object with props to inject into the root.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-twitter`:** Rename `uiTwitterTheme` to `TwitterEditorTheme`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Rename `HasExtensions` to `ExtensionListParams`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** It is now up to extensions to decide whether commands should be active when the editor is editable. `isEditable` method is now passed into the `commands` method as a means of checking.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** All RemirrorProviders now require a `children` prop. This prevents a bug when rendering in non-dom environments.

- Add support for [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- `@remirror/editor-twitter`, `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg` : Use image-snapshot testing to ensure SSR and DOM rendered editors are identical.
- Update husky command from ~~`yarn stop:hooks`~~ and ~~`yarn start:hooks`~~ to `yarn husky:stop` and `yarn husky:start`.

### Remove

- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/react-utils` `@remirror/react` `@remirror/editor-markdown` `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg`:** Remove customRootProp from `RemirrorProps`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Remove `isEditable` guard from command functions. It is now up to the command or the caller to decide if it should run when the editor is not editable. To help with this command params with the method `isEditable` are passed to the `commands` method of the extension.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Remove exports `GetItemParamsMethod`
  `createFlexibleFunctionMap` `hasExtensionProperty` `extensionPropertyMapper` `transformExtensionMap` `ignoreFunctions`.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-06-18

### Added

- Support for server side rendering (SSR) with passing integration tests for NextJS.
- Support for plain extension with styles impacting SSR (PlaceholderExtension can be rendered in SSR).
- **`@remirror/core`:** `ssrTransformer` added to extension methods as a way of wrapping and transforming the JSX element produced on the server.
- **`@remirror/core`:** `SSRComponent: React.ComponentType<any>` option added to `MarkExtensionOptions` and `NodeExtensionOptions` as a way of overriding the component rendered in an SSR environment.
- **`@remirror/core`:** `SSRHelpersExtension` added as a shorthand way of defining SSR transformations via ssrTransformer.
- **`@remirror/core`:** `injectBrIntoEmptyParagraphs` added for better SSR rendering.
- **`@remirror/react-utils`:** `isReactFragment` added to test if an element is a fragment.
- Create better unit tests for SSR.
- Add a changelog with changes starting from `v0.1.0`

### Changed

- üí• **BREAKING:** Rename `@remirror/ui-*` packages to `@remirror/editor-*` for example @remirror/ui-twitter is .now called `@remirror/editor-twitter`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-twitter`:** Rename `UITwitter` and `TwitterUI` to `TwitterEditor`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-markdown`:** Rename `UIMarkdown` and `MarkdownUI` to `MarkdownEditor`.
- üí• **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg`:** Rename `UIWysiwyg` and `WysiwygUI` to `WysiwygEditor`.
- Speed up tslint by enforcing linting on individual modules (new `tsconfig.lint.json` files).
- Remove `cx` import from `emotion` library in from `@remirror/core` to reduce the bundle size.
- Set `@emotion/core` and `@emotion/styled` as peer dependencies.

### Remove

- üí• **BREAKING:** `@remirror/ui-*` packages.
