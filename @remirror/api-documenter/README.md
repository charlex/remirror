# @microsoft/api-documenter

This is taken from https://github.com/microsoft/web-build-tools/tree/master/apps/api-documenter and updated to suit the project.

This tool can be used to generate an online API reference manual for your TypeScript library.
It reads the \*.api.json data files produced by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/),
and then generates web pages using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
file format.

For more information, see the
[Generating Docs](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/) article from the API Extractor documentation.
